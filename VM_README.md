SOF-ELK速 Virtual Machine Distribution
=======
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philhagen/sof-elk/master/lib/sof-elk_logo_sm.png)

**Background**

This page contains details for the SOF-ELK速 (Security Operations and Forensics Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) VM.
The VM is provided as a community resource but is covered at varying depths in the following SANS course(s):

* [SANS FOR572, Advanced Network Forensics and Analysis](http://for572.com/course)
* [SANS SEC555, SIEM with Tactical Analysis](http://for572.com/sec555)
* [SANS SEC501, Advanced Security Essentials - Enterprise Defender](http://for572.com/sec501)

The latest version of the VM itself is available here: <http://for572.com/sof-elk-vm>

All parsers and dashboards for this VM are now maintained in this Github repository.  You can access them directly via <http://for572.com/sof-elk-git>

**General Information**

* The VM was created with VMware Fusion v11.0.2 and ships with virtual hardware v12.
  * If you're using an older version of VMware Workstation/Fusion/Player, you will likely need to convert the VM back to a previous version of the hardware.
  * Some VMware software provides this function via the GUI, or you may find the [free "VMware vCenter Converter" tool](http://www.vmware.com/products/converter) helpful.
* The VM is deployed with the "NAT" network mode enabled
* Credentials:
  * username: ```elk_user```
    * password: ```forensics```
    * has sudo access to run ALL commands
* Logstash will ingest all files from the following filesystem locations:
  * ```/logstash/syslog/```: Syslog-formatted data
  * ```/logstash/nfarch/```: Archived NetFlow output, formatted as described below
  * ```/logstash/httpd/```: Apache logs in common, combined, or vhost-combined formats
  * ```/logstash/passivedns/```: Logs from the passivedns utility
* NOTICE: Remember that syslog DOES NOT reflect the year of a log entry!  Therefore, Logstash has been configured to look for a year value in the path to a file.  For example:  ```/logstash/syslog/2015/var/log/messages``` will assign all entries from that file to the year 2015.  If no year is present, the current year will be assumed.  This is enabled only for the `/logstash/syslog/` directory.
* Commands to be familiar with:
    * ```/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_clear.py```: DESTROY contents of the Elasticsearch database.  Most frequently used with an index name base (e.g. ```sof-elk_clear.py -i logstash``` will delete all data from the Elasticsearch ```logstash-*``` indexes.  Other options detailed with the ```-h``` flag.
    * ```/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_update.sh```: Update the SOF-ELK速 configuration files from the Github repository.  (Requires sudo.)
* Files to be familiar with:
    * ```/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf```: Symlinks to github-based FOR572-specific configs that address several common log formats:
        * syslog
        * DHCPD
        * BIND querylog
        * iptables
        * Squid access_log
        * Windows messages sent by Snare
        * Passivedns (<http://for572.com/passivedns>)
        * HTTPD Common/Combined/vhost+Combined/SSL Access Logs
        * Live NetFlow v5 and archived NetFlow records
    * ```/usr/local/sof-elk/*```: Clone of Github repository (<http://for572.com/sof-elk-git> - public/v20190102 branch)

**Latest Distribution Vitals**

* Basic details on the distribution

  * Filename and size: ```Public SOF ELK v20190102.zip``` (```1,707,502,761``` bytes)
  * MD5: ```8468fdce074445e6df6c0fcae791e1de```
  * SHA256: ```b6ae8f1f5ebc4792e6ad7d5a771316d7ab4b8855cf3928c34925b2851fb3a2a7```

**How to Use**

* Restore the "Deployment" snapshot
* Boot the VM
* Log into the VM with the ```elk_user``` credentials (see above)
  * Logging in via SSH recommended, but if using the console login and a non-US keyboard, run ```sudo loadkeys uk```, replacing ```uk``` as needed for your local keyboard mapping
* cd to one of the ```/logstash/*/``` directories as appropriate
* Place files in this location (Mind the above warning about the year for syslog data.  Files must also be readable by the "logstash" user.)
* Open the main Kibana dashboard using the Kibana URL shown in the pre-authentication screen, ```http://<ip_address>:5601```
    * This dashboard gives a basic overview of what data has been loaded and how many records are present
    * There are links to several stock dashboards on the left hand side
* Wait for Logstash to parse the input files, load the appropriate dashboard URL, and start interacting with your data

**Sample Data Included**

* Syslog data in `~elk_user/lab-2.3_source_evidence/`
  * Unzip each of these files **into the `/logstash/syslog/` directory**, such as: `cd /logstash/syslog/ ; unzip ~elk_user/lab-2.3_source_evidence/<file>`
  * Use the time frame `2013-06-08 15:00:00` to `2013-06-08 23:30:00` to examine this data.
* NetFlow data in `~elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/`
  * Use the `nfdump2sof-elk.sh` script and write output **to the `/logstash/nfarch/` directory**, such as: `cd /home/elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/ ; nfdump2sof-elk.sh -e 10.3.58.1 -r ~elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/lab-3.1_netflow.txt`
  * Use the time frame `2012-04-02` to `2012-04-07` to examine this data.

**Ingesting Archived NetFlow**

To ingest existing NetFlow evidence, it must be parsed into a specific format.  The included ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh``` script will take care of this.
* Read from single file: ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh -r /path/to/netflow/nfcapd.201703190000 -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_1.txt```
* Read recursively from directory: ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh -r /path/to/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_2.txt```
* Optionally, you can specify the IP address of the exporter that created the flow data: ```nfdump2sof-elk.sh -e 10.3.58.1 -r /path/to/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_3.txt```
