    # PJH: Realistically, we should have a better way to handle the Payload field, which is a bunch of
    #      json and possibly the PayloadData[1-6] fields.  This is a starting point, though.... It's
    #      goingto be a challenge because of the widely varied content in those fields. Keeping as a
    #      string for the time being.
    #      It will probably need a ruby filter script but I have no idea how complex that will be.
